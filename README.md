# Shiny Application: Predicting Air Quality
## Introduction
The goal of this application is to predict air pollution measured by the amount of Ozone based on wind speed, solar radiation, temperature, month (From May to September) and day (forom 1 to 31). This application takes inputs from user for specific wind speed, solar radiation, temperature, month and day and predicts the amount of Ozone in the air as a measure of air pollution.  



## Data used in this application
